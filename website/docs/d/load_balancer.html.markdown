# vultr_load_balancer

Get information about a Vultr load balancer.

## Example Usage

Get the information for a load balancer by `label`:

```hcl
data "vultr_load_balancer" "my_lb" {
  filter {
    name   = "label"
    values = ["my-lb-label"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `filter` - (Required) Query parameters for finding load balancers.

The `filter` block supports the following:

* `name` - Attribute name to filter with.
* `values` - One or more values filter with.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `region` - The region your load balancer is deployed in.
* `label` - The load balancers label.
* `balancing_algorithm` - The balancing algorithm for your load balancer.
* `proxy_protocol` - Boolean value that indicates if Proxy Protocol is enabled.
* `cookie_name` - Name for your given sticky session.
* `ssl_redirect` - Boolean value that indicates if HTTP calls will be redirected to HTTPS.
* `has_ssl` - Boolean value that indicates if SSL is enabled.
* `auto_ssl_domain` - The auto SSL domain configuration for a load balancer. This can be a root domain (example.com) or include a subdomain (sub.example.com).
* `attached_instances` - Array of instances that are currently attached to the load balancer.
* `status` - Current status for the load balancer
* `ipv4` - IPv4 address for your load balancer.
* `ipv6` - IPv6 address for your load balancer.
* `health_check` - Defines the way load balancers should check for health. The configuration of a `health_check` is listed below.
* `forwarding_rules` - Defines the forwarding rules for a load balancer. The configuration of a `forwarding_rules` is listened below.
* `private_network` - (Deprecated: use `vpc` instead) Defines the private network the load balancer is attached to.
* `vpc` - Defines the VPCthe load balancer is attached to.

`health_check` supports the following

* `protocol` - The protocol used to traffic requests to the load balancer. Possible values are "http", "https", or "tcp".
* `path` - The path on the attached instances that the load balancer should check against.
* `port` - The assigned port (integer) on the attached instances that the load balancer should check against.
* `check_interval` - Time in seconds to perform health check. Default value is 15.
* `response_timeout` - Time in seconds to wait for a health check response. Default value is 5.
* `unhealthy_threshold` - Number of failed attempts encountered before failover. Default value is 5.
* `healthy_threshold` -  Number of failed attempts encountered before failover. Default value is 5. 

`forwarding_rules` supports the following

* `frontend_protocol` - Protocol on load balancer side. Possible values: "http", "https", "tcp".
* `frontend_port` - Port on load balancer side.
* `backend_protocol` - Protocol on instance side. Possible values: "http", "https", "tcp".
* `target_port` - Port on instance side.

`firewall_rules` supports the following
* `frontend_port` - (Required) Port on load balancer side.
* `ip_type` - (Required) The type of ip this rule is - may be either v4 or v6.
* `source` - (Required) IP address with subnet that is allowed through the firewall. You may also pass in `cloudflare` which will allow only CloudFlares IP range.
